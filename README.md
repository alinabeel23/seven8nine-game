## Brief
The brief required the recreation of a game of my choice using HTML, CSS, and Vanila JavaScript only in the span of a week.

## Development Process
As this was my first development project, I faced a significant learning curve and many obstacles. Initially, I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve, but I struggled to translate my ideas into code.

To begin, I started by building the basic structure of the game in HTML, then proceeded to add some interactive functionality using Vanilla JavaScript. I faced many challenges such as not being able to get the snake to leave from one side and come in from the other. These difficulties led to me exploring different approaches and techniques. Despite these challenges, I managed to create a functional game within the given timeframe. However, there were several features that I was unable to implement due to my limited experience. Nevertheless, I am proud of what I achieved and excited to continue learning and developing my skills.

## What is it exactly
I chose to build a game that is modern take on a the classic Snake 2 game, where the player must catch as many of the circles before the time runs out.

## Instructions
To move aroun, the user must use the arrow keys and catch as many of the orange circles before the time runs out.
Once you run out of time, you will be greeted with a bright orange screen that displays your score as well as reset button if you wish to play again.

## Deployment
You may find the deployed version of the game test it out yourself over [here](https://itsalinabeel.com/seven8nine/)!

## Future Enhancements
Due to the nature of this project, I was unable to implement all the features I would have like to, so whenever I get the chance to get back to this, I would like to give the snake the ability to grow in length as well as a some sort of blockades, traps and power ups to intensify the user experience.
