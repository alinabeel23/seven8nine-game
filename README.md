# seven8nine

## Brief
The brief required the recreation of a game of my choice using HTML, CSS, and Vanila JavaScript only in the span of a week.


## What is it exactly
I chose to build a game that is modern take on a the classic Snake 2 game, where the player must catch as many of the circles before the time runs out.

## Instructions
To move aroun, the user must use the arrow keys and catch as many of the orange circles before the time runs out.


## Deployment
You may find the deployed version over [here](https://itsalinabeel.com/seven8nine/)

## Future Enhancements
Due to the nature of this project, I was unable to implement all the features I would have like to, so whenever I get the chance to get back to this, I would like to give the snake the ability to grow in length as well as a some sort of blockades, traps and power ups to intensify the user experience.
